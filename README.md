# BudgetVikings

This project aims to be a 'remake' of sorts of one of my all time favorite games [War of the Vikings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFhLl8N747I), which was shut down by Paradox a few years ago. While it may never see the light of a steam release, it will at least serve as a learning experience for better understanding of UE5.

Core features:
* Unreal Engine 5
* C++ and Blueprints
* Online Multiplayer
* Dedicated Servers with Steam
* G.A.S utilization for replicated melee combat gameplay
* MetaSounds for audio
* Complete options menu (gameplay settings, audio, graphics, UI, keybinds)
* ideally full controller support
* Gameplay Tutorial
* Loadout Editor (cosmetics, emotes, perks, weapons)
* EOS Integration for Player Stats, Loadouts and Unlocks
* Analytics Integration, most likely [Aptabase](https://aptabase.com/)
* User feedback and bug report integration, most likely [Baserow](https://baserow.io/)
